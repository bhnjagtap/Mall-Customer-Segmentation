Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project focuses on customer segmentation using a mall customer dataset. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their spending behavior and annual income, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Annual Income: The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending habits (1-100).
Project Overview
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct clusters using K-means clustering, based on their annual income and spending score.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset.
Analyzed and cleaned the data for any inconsistencies or missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualized the distribution of features like annual income and spending score.
Examined relationships between different features.
K-means Clustering:

Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to the dataset.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Segmented customers into five distinct clusters based on their annual income and spending score.
Cluster Analysis:

Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster:
Cluster 1: Moderate spenders with moderate incomes.
Cluster 2: High-income, high-spending customers.
Cluster 3: Low-income, high-spending customers.
Cluster 4: Low-income, low-spending customers.
Cluster 5: High-income, low-spending customers.
Visualized the clusters to understand customer segments better.
Results
The segmentation provided insights into different customer groups:
Cluster 2 (High-income, high-spenders) are key targets for premium products and services.
Cluster 3 (Low-income, high-spenders) could benefit from loyalty programs or discounts.
Cluster 5 (High-income, low-spenders) represents untapped potential and may require different marketing approaches.
Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.
Pandas: For data handling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing K-means clustering.
